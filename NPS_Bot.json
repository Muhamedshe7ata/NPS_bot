//
The following code was created with the objective of using the flowbot to save a minimum of 30 minutes each month.
 Through the implementation of automation and robotics, repetitive and time-consuming tasks have been streamlined,
  freeing up valuable time that can be better utilized. Not only has this bot achieved significant time savings, 
  but it has also reduced the error rate significantly, increasing efficiency and accuracy in the process. 
  As we move forward, the goal for the upcoming quarter is to further increase productivity by achieving a savings of 15 minutes per day. 
  With continued dedication and effort, we are confident that this objective will be met, leading to even greater success and progress in the future
